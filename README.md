# Team Lewandowski for Filmvisarna - Web application for movie theater

## Introduction

This application is a school project built in React. It was created by Sebastian Mineur (NervousNerve), Amanda Olsson (sotigt), Lisa Hansson (lisastina), Pucha Stephanie Meyers (Puchasay), Johan Markstr√∂m (sgtBurly), Henrik Lood (henrik-lood) and Saga Swahn (hejsaga).

### Goal and requirements

The main goal of the application was to build our first fullstack project as a group in React: a web application for a movie theater. The application was created from a list of strict requirements and user stories. Product owners expected a fully functional booking system, with the exception of integrating payment solutions.

The core functionalities were to facilitate a responsive website where users can browse, watch trailers, search and filter among a selection of movies. All tickets are reserved and bound to specific users who can register, see their past bookings and manage their upcoming shows.
